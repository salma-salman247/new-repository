                The history of Sally's Treats dates back to 2012, when it was founded by a group of friends who shared a
                passion for good food and community.
                What started as a small, family-owned bakery in a tucked-away corner of the city quickly gained a loyal
                following
                for its unique blend of comfort and quality. Inspired by a love for home-baked goods and the warmth of
                shared
                gatherings, the founders crafted a menu that reflected their upbringing, with each treat carefully
                designed to
                evoke memories of simpler times. Over the years, Sally's Treats has grown, expanding its reach while
                staying
                true to its roots of serving delicious, wholesome sweets in an inviting, relaxed atmosphere. Today, it
                stands
                as a beloved local gem, known for its welcoming vibe and dedication to bringing people together over
                delightful pastries and desserts.
